You are an AI assistant tasked with performing a multi-faceted code review of the following JavaScript code snippet.

**Code to Review:**
```javascript
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
```

Your Task:
Analyze the code snippet sequentially from the perspectives of the following three expert personas. For each persona, provide specific, actionable recommendations and observations to improve the code. Structure your response with clear headings for each persona.
1. Persona: Experienced Developer
Focus on:
* Code clarity, readability, and modern JavaScript practices (e.g., variable declarations var vs let/const, type handling for data: any, conciseness of expressions).
* Maintainability, error handling (e.g., what if data[i] is malformed?), and adherence to software development best practices.
* Function design, modularity, and potential improvements to the overall structure.
* Completeness of functions, particularly the //TODO in saveToDatabase and its implications.
2. Persona: Security Engineer
Focus on:
* Input validation: The risks associated with data: any and lack of validation for properties like id, name, email, status. How to prevent processing of unexpected or malicious data structures.
* Data sanitization: Potential for injection vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, NoSQL injection) if the processed user data (especially name or email) is used in other parts of the system (e.g., rendered in UI, used in database queries) without proper sanitization.
* Secure data handling: Concerns around logging user data (console.log) and potential information leakage.
* Security implications of the saveToDatabase stub: What security measures should be considered when implementing the actual database interaction (e.g., parameterized queries, secure connection handling).
3. Persona: Performance Specialist
Focus on:
* Efficiency of data processing: The for loop's performance for large datasets, alternatives like Array.prototype.map.
* Object creation: Impact of creating a new user object in each iteration on memory and speed, especially for very large data arrays.
* Memory usage: Overall memory footprint of the users array.
* Impact of console.log: Performance implications of logging, especially in production or high-frequency scenarios.
* Asynchronous operations: Considerations for saveToDatabase, which would typically be an I/O-bound asynchronous operation. Discuss the performance implications of synchronous vs. asynchronous database saving.
